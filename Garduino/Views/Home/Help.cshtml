                <strong>API</strong> (<strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface) is a set of functions and procedures that allow the

            <p>
                <strong class="text-success">Garduino device</strong> refers to any kind of device that follows basic Garduino principles (Device, Code, Entry),
                their respective properties and that is able to communicate with this web API.
            </p>
            <p>
                That said, Arduino&reg; microcontrollers are currently the only ones that have real code behind themselves.<br />
                The easiest way to get a Garduino system is to follow and use information & code provided from <a href="http://github.com/ffhan/garduino">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some basic components that you need for a stripped down Garduino system are:
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Arduino (Uno/Mega)</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Ethernet shield</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Capacitative soil moisture sensor</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Air & humidity sensor</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Real Time Clock</li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-footer">
            Be aware that the component list depends greatly on <b>your</b> needs & specifications.<br />

            Garduino web API is designed to be able to send <b>any</b> code to <b>any</b> device, though it is advisable to keep it simple and

        <p>
            The main principle for extending and customizing Garduino system is that there has to be a clear distinction between what's
            user controlled and what is device controlled.<br/>
            This ensures that device runs exactly as intended and enables long-distance control, since you don't have to be near the device
            to know that it functions properly.<br/>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, turning the lights to always be ON require <code>Global lock OFF</code>&rarr;<code>Light admin ON</code>&rarr;<code>Lights ON</code><br/>
            If there is something wrong with how the device runs you can easily look at its' internal state in <span class="text-primary">Device</span> details.
